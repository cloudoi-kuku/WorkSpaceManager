## ðŸš€ Feature Details

### Work Item Management (Next Feature)

**Objective**: Implement a comprehensive work item tracking system with CRUD operations, filtering, and session integration.

**Components to Implement**:
- Work item data models and state management
- Work item form with validation
- Work item list with filtering and sorting
- Session integration for work item operations

**Technical Considerations**:
- Use the session management feature for state persistence
- Implement optimistic updates for a responsive UI
- Add recovery points for work item operations
- Create a virtualized list for performance with large datasets

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define work item data models and interfaces
2. Create work item context provider
3. Implement form components for creating and editing work items
4. Build list views with filtering and sorting
5. Add session integration and recovery points
6. Implement API integration with Payload CMS

**Resources**:
- Reference the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for detailed requirements
- Use existing UI components from the components directory
- Leverage session management hooks for state persistence

## Development Notes

### Current Development Focus

Preparing to start the Work Item Management feature after completing the Session Management implementation. The Session Management feature provides the foundation for state persistence that will be used by all other features.

### Recent Changes

- Implemented SessionContext provider for cross-window state management
- Created usePersistentState and useSessionForm hooks
- Added ErrorBoundary component for error recovery
- Integrated session management with the main application UI

### Technical Challenges

Current technical challenges include:
- Ensuring proper error handling and recovery
- Optimizing performance for state synchronization
- Testing cross-window communication scenarios

### Next Steps

1. Start implementing Work Item Management feature
2. Create work item data models and state management
3. Build form components for creating and editing work items
4. Implement session integration for work items
