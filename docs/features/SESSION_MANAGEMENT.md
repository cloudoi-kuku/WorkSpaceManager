# Session Management Feature

## Status: COMPLETED

**Implementation Date:** April 25, 2025

## Overview

The Session Management feature provides robust error resilience and work continuity through session tracking, recovery points, and persistent state management. This feature ensures that users never lose their work between browser sessions and windows.

## Implemented Functionality

- [x] **Cross-Window Session Tracking**: Maintain consistent state across multiple browser windows and tabs using BroadcastChannel API
- [x] **Automatic Recovery Points**: Create periodic snapshots of workspace state at configurable intervals
- [x] **Manual Recovery Points**: Allow users to create named recovery points at important milestones
- [x] **Session Resumption**: Enable resuming work from previous sessions
- [x] **Activity Tracking**: Monitor user activity to prevent data loss during idle periods
- [x] **Form State Persistence**: Automatically save and restore form state across sessions
- [x] **Error Boundary Integration**: Capture and recover from application errors
- [x] **Local Storage Provider**: Persist data to localStorage with fallback mechanisms
- [x] **IndexedDB Storage Provider**: Support for larger datasets using IndexedDB

## Key Components

- `SessionContext.tsx`: Core context provider for session management
- `SessionControls.tsx`: UI components for user interaction with sessions
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Error handling and recovery
- `usePersistentState.ts`: Hook for state persistence
- `useSessionForm.ts`: Form state persistence hook
- `storage.ts`: Storage provider implementations
- `utils.ts`: Utility functions for safe operations

## Technical Implementation

The session management feature is implemented using React Context and custom hooks. It provides a simple API for components to interact with session management while handling the complexity of cross-window communication and error recovery internally.

The feature uses:
- Browser APIs: localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, BroadcastChannel
- React's Context API and hooks
- Error boundaries for crash recovery
- Debounced auto-save for performance

## Integration

The feature is integrated throughout the application:
- App.tsx wraps the entire application in SessionProvider
- Form components use useSessionForm for state persistence
- Error boundaries are placed strategically to catch and recover from errors
- Recovery points are created at key user interaction points

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Sync with backend for multi-device support
- [ ] Compression for large state objects
- [ ] Conflict resolution for collaborative editing
- [ ] Enhanced recovery UX with visual diffs
- [ ] Migration path for state structure changes

## Notes

This implementation addresses the session persistence challenges outlined in the technical challenges document. It ensures that users can seamlessly continue their work across browser sessions without data loss, even in the event of browser crashes or unexpected closures.
