# Next Steps for WorkSpaceManager

We've set up the Payload CMS backend with all the required collections and endpoints. Here are the next steps for continuing development:

## Backend

1. **Authentication and Access Control**
   - Fine-tune access control rules for collections
   - Implement role-based permissions
   - Add more user profile fields if needed

2. **API Testing**
   - Test all endpoints with tools like Postman or Insomnia
   - Ensure proper error handling for edge cases
   - Verify payload validation

3. **Webhook Integration**
   - Implement webhooks for critical events (e.g., session status changes)
   - Create notification system for workflow transitions
   - Set up email notifications for approvals

4. **Background Jobs**
   - Add scheduled tasks for cleaning up expired recovery points
   - Implement automatic session expiration for inactive sessions
   - Set up recurring project status reports

## Frontend

1. **Set Up React Application**
   - Configure API integration with the backend
   - Implement authentication flow
   - Set up context providers for state management

2. **Session Management**
   - Implement session tracking and recovery in the frontend
   - Create UI for managing sessions
   - Add auto-save functionality for work context

3. **Workspace and Project Management**
   - Build UI for creating and managing workspaces and projects
   - Implement team member management
   - Create dashboards for project overview

4. **Feature and Work Item Management**
   - Implement feature tracking with workflow stages
   - Create work item UI with dependencies
   - Add kanban board for visualizing work items

5. **LLM Integration**
   - Set up Ollama connection for local LLM inference
   - Implement the AI assistant interface
   - Create code generation and analysis features

## Integration

1. **GitHub Integration**
   - Implement OAuth flow for GitHub authentication
   - Set up repository syncing
   - Create issue/PR integration with work items

2. **Offline Support**
   - Implement offline-first functionality
   - Create sync queue for operations when offline
   - Add conflict resolution for concurrent edits

3. **Dependency Visualization**
   - Create interactive graph for visualizing dependencies
   - Implement impact analysis for changes
   - Add dependency health metrics

## Documentation and Testing

1. **API Documentation**
   - Document all endpoints and their parameters
   - Create examples for common API operations
   - Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

2. **User Documentation**
   - Create user guides for core features
   - Build in-app help system
   - Make tutorial videos for complex workflows

3. **Testing Suite**
   - Set up unit tests for critical functions
   - Create integration tests for backend APIs
   - Implement end-to-end tests for key workflows

## DevOps

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up automated testing
   - Configure deployment workflows
   - Implement database migration strategies

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add structured logging
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Create alerts for critical errors

3. **Security**
   - Perform security audit
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add two-factor authentication

## Important Considerations

- **Data Migration**: Plan for migrating data between development, staging, and production
- **Performance**: Monitor database query performance with large datasets
- **Scalability**: Consider sharding or partitioning for large workspaces

By following these steps, you'll be able to build out the complete WorkSpaceManager application as specified in the project requirements.
